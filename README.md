# British-Airways-Report-based-on-reviews
Welcome to my blog on Developing reports with Tableau. I took the overall review of the Airways. I prepared a report based on the reviews from the Passengers and displayed it in the Dashboard which helps in making strategic decisions for the area where it needs to be focused for better improvement.

Tableau is a data visualization platform that focuses on business intelligence (BI), which is the analysis of business information. It has become very popular recently because of its flexibility and visual appeal. This BI tool lets organizations gain insights from their data and build visualizations.

Data analysis is a game-changer for optimizing business operations, empowering informed decisions and strategic planning. Recently, I worked on a project where I analyzed British Airways review data, designed an interactive dashboard, and visualized the insights using Tableau. In this article, I’ll walk you through my approach, from collecting the data to crafting the interactive dashboard.

## Objective
In this project, I have taken the data from the British Airways review. Using the Data, I have developed a Dashboard that will be helpful when deciding to improve in a particular area, where it needs attention.

My wireframe for this project is,

## Data Source
To get the Source data, check raw data folder.

After importing the dataset, I started creating the Dashboard

## Creating Dashboard
First, create a separate sheet for the chart regarding the Average overall Ratings by Month and a separate sheet for the Average overall Ratings by Aircraft.

And a sheet to represent the Reviews in the case of the Country.

To make the visualisation look better, I created a filter with Year and month in it which will be easily accessible.

And a filter to vary the Aircraft, Seat type, Traveller type and based on reviews.

Finally, it was ready to get all the sheets together in one Dashboard.

## Conclusion
This dashboard will be useful for people to make strategic decisions for the area where it needs to be focused for better improvement.
It’s an interactive Dashboard which makes it more efficient.
The filters help in making a better view for the user.

You can check my Dashboard, which I made using Tableau.
